This repository contains exercises for learning Dart.

## Exercises

### 01 - Hello World

The [Hello World](exercises/01-basic/01-hello-world.dart) exercise is a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

## How to Run

To run an exercise, navigate to its directory and use the `dart run` command. For example:

```

### 02 - Data Types

The [Data Types](exercises/01-basic/02-datatypes.dart) exercise demonstrates the usage of different data types in Dart. It declares variables of various types and prints their values.

The exercise covers:

- Numeric types (`int` and `double`)
- Nullable types
- String interpolation
- Multiline strings
- Boolean types
- Lists and Sets
- Maps or Dictionaries

In the exercise, you'll also learn how to manipulate lists and sets in Dart. A list of villains is created and then updated by changing the villain at index 0 and adding a new villain at the end. The list is then converted to a set to remove any duplicates, and then converted back to a list.

To run this exercise, use the following commands:

```sh
cd exercises/01-basic
dart run 02-datatypes.dart
```

### 03 - Final and Const

The [Final and Const](exercises/01-basic/03-finalConst.dart) exercise demonstrates the usage of `final` and `const` variables in Dart. It declares `final`, `const`, and `late final` variables, and prints their values. It also shows how to declare `final` and `const` lists and the difference between them.

The exercise covers:

- `final` variables
- `const` variables
- `late final` variables
- `final` lists
- `const` lists

To run this exercise, use the following commands:

```sh
cd exercises/01-basic

```

### 04 - Comments
