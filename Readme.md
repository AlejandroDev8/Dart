# Dart Exercises

This repository contains exercises for learning Dart.

## Exercises

### 01 - Hello World

The [Hello World](exercises/01-basic/01-hello-world.dart) exercise is a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

## How to Run

To run an exercise, navigate to its directory and use the `dart run` command. For example:

```sh
cd exercises/01-basic
dart run 01-hello-world.dart
```

### 02 - Data Types

The [Data Types](exercises/01-basic/02-datatypes.dart) exercise demonstrates the usage of different data types in Dart. It declares variables of various types and prints their values.

The exercise covers:

- Numeric types (`int` and `double`)
- Nullable types
- String interpolation
- Multiline strings
- Boolean types
- Lists and Sets
- Maps or Dictionaries

In the exercise, you'll also learn how to manipulate lists and sets in Dart. A list of villains is created and then updated by changing the villain at index 0 and adding a new villain at the end. The list is then converted to a set to remove any duplicates, and then converted back to a list.

To run this exercise, use the following commands:

```sh
cd exercises/01-basic
dart run 02-datatypes.dart
```

### 03 - Final and Const

The [Final and Const](exercises/01-basic/03-finalConst.dart) exercise demonstrates the usage of `final` and `const` variables in Dart. It declares `final`, `const`, and `late final` variables, and prints their values. It also shows how to declare `final` and `const` lists and the difference between them.

The exercise covers:

- `final` variables
- `const` variables
- `late final` variables
- `final` lists
- `const` lists

To run this exercise, use the following commands:

```sh
cd exercises/01-basic
dart run 03-finalConst.dart
```

### 04 - Comments

The [Comments](exercises/01-basic/04-comments.dart) exercise demonstrates the usage of different types of comments in Dart. It includes inline comments, multiline comments, and documentation comments.

The exercise covers:

- Inline comments
- Multiline comments
- Documentation comments

To run this exercise, use the following commands:

```sh
cd exercises/01-basic
dart run 04-comments.dart
```

### 05 - Arithmetic Operators

The [Arithmetic Operators](exercises/01-basic/05-operators-arit.dart) exercise demonstrates the usage of different arithmetic operators in Dart. It includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and increment/decrement operators.

The exercise covers:

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/` and `~/`)
- Modulus (`%`)
- Increment (`++`)
- Decrement (`--`)
- Addition assignment (`+=`)
- Subtraction assignment (`-=`)

To run this exercise, use the following commands:

```sh
cd exercises/01-basic
dart run 05-operators-arit.dart
```

### 06 - Other Operators

The [Other Operators](exercises/01-basic/06-operators.dart) exercise demonstrates the usage of different types of operators in Dart, including relational and type test.

The exercise covers:

- Relational operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=`, `==`)
- Type test operators (`is`, `is!`)

To run this exercise, use the following commands:

```sh
cd exercises/01-basic
dart run 06-operators.dart
```

### 02 - Control Structures

#### 01 - Taking Input

The [Taking Input](exercises/02-control/01-take-input.dart) exercise demonstrates how to take input from the user in Dart using the `stdin.readLineSync()` function. It covers:

- Importing the `dart:io` library
- Using the `stdin.readLineSync()` function to take user input
- Parsing the input to different data types

To run this exercise, use the following commands:

```sh
cd exercises/02-control
dart run 01-take-input.dart
```

#### 02 - If-Else Statements

The [If-Else Statements](exercises/02-control/02-ifelse.dart) exercise demonstrates the usage of if-else control structures in Dart. It covers:

- Using `if` statements to control the flow of the program
- Using `else` statements to provide an alternative path for the program
- Using `else if` statements to check multiple conditions

To run this exercise, use the following commands:

```sh
cd exercises/02-control
dart run 02-ifelse.dart
```

#### 02.1 - If-Else Exercise

The [If-Else Exercise](exercises/02-control/02-exercise-ifelse.dart) is a practice exercise for using if-else control structures in Dart. It covers:

- Using `if` statements to control the flow of the program
- Using `else` statements to provide an alternative path for the program
- Using `else if` statements to check multiple conditions

To run this exercise, use the following commands:

```sh
cd exercises/02-control
dart run 02-exercise-ifelse.dart
```
